        <h2>Contrast: Amazon</h2>
        <img src="./amazon_shot.jpg" alt="Amazon">
        <p>Amazon has good contrast in its uses of text color and background color together. 
            The contrast helps to draw your eye to specific points on the screen. 
            This is very beneficial for Amazon as it is an eshop and so wants to draw attention to products. 
            Thankfully, the attention drawing is done with good, eye catching contrast. 
            There are some sites that use colors that clash, and that makes it look so much worse. <br>

        <h3>Repetition: GitHub</h3>

        <p>
            Repetition gives a clean, consistent layout to a website. 
            GitHub has a good layout that shows the connection to everything on their site. 
            The look for repositories and the two activities sections are very similar. 
            This helps show a good layout of the page and gives clear navigation. 
            It also gives a good consistent look to the site.

        <h3>Alignment: Church of Jesus Christ</h3>

        <p>
            The Church's webiste has clean alignment. They have the menu tools aligned well as well as the various images
            and videos. This is really nice for the user to help them in navigation around the site. 
            Having everything lined up makes the site much more pleasent to look at as well as helping with reading the site.
