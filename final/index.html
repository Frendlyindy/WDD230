      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am beginning to produce some podcasts for entertainment. The purpose of this website will be to host links, graphics and forums for the podcast. There will be some simple forums for people to write in that allow them to give feedback on the show. There will be artwork and brief descriptions of episodes. There are multiple shows and there will be an index page for that. You will be able to see all the shows, their episodes with art and descriptions and titles. It will be a place to be entertained and hang out. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My fellow nerds out there. The podcasts cover video games, movies, books and more. Anyone who is a fan of fiction can find a home here. The first podcasts that will be posted will be about directors, so movie fans will love it here. They will be able to learn about films they may not have seen, or learn something new about ones they have. They will be able to be apart of disscusions of films and write in reviews. There will be email and social media links for them to connect to us with and be a part of the nerdy community here.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Simple Intro
This is about the main content of the site. The main page is where people will find the main info about the website. This website is the hub for my podcasting network I am starting. It is not hosting the audio files, but it will be a way of looking into the podcast and accessing links to each episode of the various shows. Each podcast will be about something nerdy in some way, shape or fashion. The people who will come here are going to be big nerds, plain and simple. It is a place for nerds to listen to these topics discussed in the podcasts, and to give their feedback.
        
        Why will they stay?
Why will the visitors to the site want to keep coming back? They will come to like, I hope, our network of podcasters. I listen to a lot of podcasts myself and tend to gravitate towards ones with hosts I know. That will be the idea behind this website. People will come to know and like the hosts and what they have to say about the various topics and fandoms. The visitors to the site can also enjoy knowing that their voice will be heard by the hosts. Questions, comments and such will be read and even some shared-on air, with the writer’s permission of course. I think this will be the big thing that keeps people coming back. Feeling like they are a part of a community of people who enjoy the same things as them and that they can have fun and thought-provoking conversations with on topics they enjoy. This is what keeps people coming back to particular networks of podcasts. I do not want to just have listeners, I want to have community members that I know and can interact with in my shows. Maybe even have some of them on the shows. 


      </p>
      
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>

        Feedback Page
 I will have a form for feedback on the corresponding page. This is where the listeners can leave their feedback, questions and comments. They will be able to inform us how we are doing on the shows, ask questions to be read and answered on air and give comments and add to the discussion of the topics of each episode of each show. They can choose whether or not leave their name or remain anonymous. There will also be a drop-down list for them to choose what they are writing in, feedback, comment, question, or other. Other is used for write ins that apply to multiple fields. Users can expect this to be where they will get a lot of their interaction with myself and the others of my network.

        The Podcasts
My podcast network is for podcasts talking about a range of nerdy topics. Anyone in any fandom we talk about is welcome. While the website does not host the podcasts themselves, that is handled by Anchor, this will be the website for the listeners to find the shows, interact with the community and the hosts and generally find what is on our network easier. All the individual episode artwork will be site exclusive, as well as the feedback to the podcast, at least for now. The current podcasts in the works include our first show, Director’s Spotlight. This show is where we look at three films from a particular director. Other shows in the works are SG-1: Report for Debriefing, Adventures in Time, Space and Television, My Friends are My Power and more. Each of these different shows will be more specific in covering different nerdy fandoms, constantly expanding the reach of the network.
